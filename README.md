# Motion Tracking Camera
 This project consisted of two parts. An OpenCV (Python) based motion tracker that called a LKM to centre the larges moving object in the cameraâ€™s frame. And an AWS EC2 instance that retrieved and stored the cameras videos. As well as, hosting a secure website for the user to download these videos. The design revolved around creating a program that could efficiently run on a Raspberry Pi Zero, utilising a stepper motor and USB webcam.
